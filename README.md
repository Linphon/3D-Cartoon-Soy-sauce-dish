This is the original picture, which is a japanese anime character.

After processing, a 3D soy sauce dish with format of stl was built for this picture. The preview of the model is showed below.

Using a FDM printer, the soy sauce dish of blue PLA material was printed. (Using white materials might have better display.) The pictures of the soy sauce dish with and without soy sauce in it are showed below.

It will take much time to build the 3D model manually, so I write a script based on Python 3.6 to build the model automatically. Though the effect is not very well right now, the printer can print the soy sauce dish model built by the script. In the future, the script will be improved.

When using this script, you just need to change the file path and several other paraments.
I think you will enjoy it, if you are a anime fan.
