# 3D-Cartoon-Soy-sauce-dish

There is a stl file for 3D Cartoon Soy sauce dish. 

And a original picture and a preview for this model.

I use a FDM printer print one, the material I use is blue PLA. (I believe the white will be better, but right now I can only get a blue one)

A picture for the printing object and a picture for the thing with diluted soy sauce in it.

I believe the SLA printer can generate a better result.
